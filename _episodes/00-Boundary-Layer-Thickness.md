# The Problem
Compare (non dimensionally) the rates of growth of the laminar boundary layer over a smooth flat plate in the following cases:

- (a) Flat plate placed in a water stream flowing at 2m/s
- (b) Flat plate placed in an air stream flowing at 2m/s
- (c) Flat plate placed in an air stream flowing at 8m/s

Density of water and air are \\(1000\\) and \\(1.2 kg/m^3\\) and viscosities are \\(0.001\\) and \\(0.000 019 Ns/m^2\\) respectively

### Growth rate generalized

From the challenge above we can now explore the growth rate for various fluids at various velocities

## Putting this together

So for a) and b):

Since \\(U\\) is the same we can show that the ratio of air to water: \\(\nu = \frac{u}{\rho} = 4\\) 

Comparing b) and c)

Since \\(\rho\\) and \\(\mu\\) are the same, we only need to consider the ratio between the square roots of \\(U\\) i.e. \\[\frac{b}{c} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{8}} = \frac{1}{2}\\]
