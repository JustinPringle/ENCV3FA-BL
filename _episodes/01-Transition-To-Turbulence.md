# The Problem
A smooth flat plate with a sharp leading edge is placed in a free stream of water flowing at 3m/s. Calculate the distance from the leading edge and the boundary layer thickness where the transition from laminar to turbulent flow may commence. Assume the density of water as \\(1000 kg/m^3\\) and viscosity as 1 centipoise.

>## Challenge
